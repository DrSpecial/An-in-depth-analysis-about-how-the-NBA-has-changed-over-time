# An-in-depth-analysis-about-how-the-NBA-has-changed-over-time
The National Basketball Association has been a pillar of popculture over the last 40 years. Icons like Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant, Lebron James, and Steph Curry have been some of the most popular figures in sports over the past few decades. The 3 point revolution, led by Curry, has changed the game over the last 10 years, with there being more shooting now than ever before, and more guards dominating the game than in years past. We were interested in using the data to explore these changes more in depth, and understanding the modern composition of the NBA. We believe that the NBA has changed substantially over the last 10 years, both in terms of style of play and an emphasis on a smaller, shooting line up, as well as in terms of talent, both internationally and from a diverse range of colleges among the United States. Throughout this Report, our analysis will center on answering the question: "How has the league changed in the last 50 years, both demographically and in terms of how it is played? We believe the league has changed substantially in terms of composition and style of play."
